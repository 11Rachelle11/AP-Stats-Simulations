# AP-Stats-Simulations
Problems from AP Stats class. 

## How it Works
Simulation - a normal simulation
Simuluation_Marbles - a simulation where you take things out and use actual numbers instead of proportions
Simulation_N - a simulation which finds how many components you need for a trial
Each problem has its own function.
